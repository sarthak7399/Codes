# https://leetcode.com/problems/total-characters-in-string-after-transformations-ii/

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# First Transformation (t = 1):
# 'a' becomes 'b' as nums[0] == 1
# 'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
# 'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
# 'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
# 'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
# String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
# Second Transformation (t = 2):
# 'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
# 'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
# 'd' becomes 'e' as nums[3] == 1
# 'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
# 'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
# String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
# Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.
