# https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-good-subarrays/

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [3,1,4,3,2,2,4], k = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 different good subarrays:
# - [3,1,4,3,2,2] that has 2 pairs.
# - [3,1,4,3,2,2,4] that has 3 pairs.
# - [1,4,3,2,2,4] that has 2 pairs.
# - [4,3,2,2,4] that has 2 pairs.
