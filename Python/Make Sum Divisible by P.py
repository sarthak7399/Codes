# https://leetcode.com/problems/make-sum-divisible-by-p/

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.
