# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-ii/

# Example 1:
# Input: k = 5, operations = [0,0,0]
# Output: "a"
# Explanation:
# Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the three operations as follows:
# Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
# Appends "aa" to "aa", word becomes "aaaa".
# Appends "aaaa" to "aaaa", word becomes "aaaaaaaa".
