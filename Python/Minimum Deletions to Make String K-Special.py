# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special/

# Example 1:
# Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c". Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.
