# https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-to-be-removed-to-make-array-sorted/

# Example 1:
# Input: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.
# Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].
