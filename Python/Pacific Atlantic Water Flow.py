# https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/

# Example 1:
# Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
# Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
# Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
# [0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
#        [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
# [1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
#        [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
# [1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
#        [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
# [2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
#        [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
# [3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
#        [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
# [3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
#        [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
# [4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
#        [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
# Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
