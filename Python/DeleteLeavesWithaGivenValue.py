# https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
# Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
# Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
# After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).

# Definition for a binary tree node.
