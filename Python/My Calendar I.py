# Example 1:
# Input
# ["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
# [[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
# Output
# [null, true, false, true]

# Explanation
# MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
# myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
# myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
# myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.

class MyCalendar:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an empty list to store the events
        self.events = []
        
    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        # Check for overlap with existing events
        for s, e in self.events:
            # If the new event overlaps with any existing event
            if not (end <= s or start >= e):  # No overlap condition: (new_end <= old_start) or (new_start >= old_end)
                return False
        # If no overlap, add the event
        self.events.append((start, end))
        return True

# Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCalendar()
# param_1 = obj.book(start,end)
