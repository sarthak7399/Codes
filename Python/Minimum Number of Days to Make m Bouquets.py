# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-make-m-bouquets/

# Example 3:
# Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
# Output: 12
# Explanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
# Here is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
# After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
# We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
# After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
# It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.
