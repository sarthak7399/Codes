# Example 1:
# Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
# After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
# With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
# Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
# Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
