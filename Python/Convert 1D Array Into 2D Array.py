# https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-1d-array-into-2d-array/

# Example 1:
# Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
# Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
# Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
# The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
# The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
