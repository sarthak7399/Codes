# https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-sorted-subarray-sums/

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
# Output: 13 
# Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

from typing import List
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        arr = []
        for i in range(n):
            s = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                s += nums[j]
                arr.append(s)
        arr.sort()
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        return sum(arr[left - 1 : right]) % mod
